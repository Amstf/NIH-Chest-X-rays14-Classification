# NIH-Chest-X-rays14-Classification
Applied transfer learning using ResNet34 for the purpose of thoracic disease classification, using multi-label chest X-ray on NIH-CHest14
chestX-ray dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with the text-mined fourteen disease image labels (where each image can have multilabels), mined from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing. Fourteen common thoracic pathologies include Atelectasis, Consolidation, Infiltration, Pneumothorax, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Effusion, Pneumonia, Pleural_thickening, Cardiomegaly, Nodule, Mass and Hernia, which is an extension of the 8 common disease patterns listed in our CVPR 2017 paper
